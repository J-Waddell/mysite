  <p id="bio">In west Philidalphia born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin out relaxin all cool and shootin some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys, they were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said "You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Belair." I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said "Fresh" and had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say this cab was rare but thought man forget it, yo on to Belair! I pulled up to a house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homie, smell ya later!" looked at my kingdom I was finally there. Sit on my throne as the Prince of Belair.</p>
